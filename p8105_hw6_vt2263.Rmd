### Flexdashboard
I have had issues with the flexdashboard: the first time i knit it using appropriate .Rmd template it renders nicely. After the first time it renders as regular .Rmd file. Has tried to fis the issues and succeded by recreating a new flexdashboard from template, but on a second run and afterwords it renders as regular htl again.
